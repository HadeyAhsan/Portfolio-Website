      "description": "Hello World! üëãüèº My name is Hadi Ahsan and I love building things. I'm a 3rd year university student majoring in Information Technology at York University, actively looking for a four month internship as a software engineer/developer in the summer. I enjoy building Python scripts and Java programs in my spare time to further increase my programming skills. The goal of my projects that I design are aimed to create viable solutions to tedious tasks we find ourselves completing in our everyday lives so that people can spend less time on unexciting activities, and more on the things that they love to do. You can learn more about my recent projects in the projects section below this. I'm constantly learning new technologies to help better my understanding of software development and what goes on in the back-end side of it all, hoping to find an internship where I can use my skills in the real world and make an impact and learn more about the job to excel in my career.",

It's a bot that fetches a web API from OpenWeatherMap and displays the current temperature in real-time in any city in the world. This project was developed as a Python script and has a host server pinging the script to stay enabled every 5 minutes to prevent inactivity using the flask web framework. So discord users can access this bot at any time they'd like, 24/7.",

I've added numerous response phrases and math equations to the script that allows the ChatBot to solve averagely complex math questions for the user. The ChatBot is also getting smarter using an import called 'ChatterBotCorpusTrainer' which trains the ChatBot to be even smarter using existing data such as being able to respond in another language, like French.",
